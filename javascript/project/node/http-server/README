## What is origin?

URL : https://www.google.com:443/maps

Origin is the combination of three things.
1. Protocol (HTTP/HTTPS)
2. Host (www.google.com)
3. Port (443)

If any of them are changed, the origin is not the same.

** The same origin policy works when staying in an origin(E.g. www.google.com) and trying to get data from another origin (E.g. www.facebook.com) using JavaScript. But post request will work for cross-origin.

## CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)

The **access-control-allow-origin** header in the server decides whether the cross-origin request will be successful or fail.
